function Update-Everything {

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        One-shot maintenance script that updates everything on a Windows laptop
        through the package managers and update channels it can find.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Each update channel runs as an isolated step, so one failure does not stop
        the rest. Every step writes its own log, and the run ends with a summary
        table and a result object.

        Steps cover an inventory pass, winget and the Microsoft Store, Windows
        Update through PSWindowsUpdate, Microsoft 365 Apps, Defender signatures,
        the PowerShell Gallery (trust and its client tooling), PowerShell modules
        and help, Chocolatey, Scoop, Python, uv, pip, pipx, conda, npm, Deno,
        Bun, pnpm, rustup, cargo binaries, Go binaries, dotnet, GitHub CLI
        extensions, the Azure and Google Cloud CLIs, the WSL kernel, PowerShell 7
        itself, this module, and the Windows Terminal default profile. The README
        lists what each runs.

        Presence of an executable is not proof a feature is installed, and package
        managers routinely return non-zero for "nothing to do", so steps that
        drive an external tool probe for it first, and each step decides which
        of its tool's exit codes are routine. Steps
        capture every stream (*>&1); only errors raised by PowerShell itself are
        counted, and those mark a step Warning rather than OK.

        FailedCount is returned rather than exited with, so calling this from a
        session does not end that session.

        Policy note: winget runs here with --accept-package-agreements, which
        accepts vendor licence agreements on your behalf for every package it
        touches. That is deliberate for unattended runs, but it is a real consent
        decision -- drop the flag if you would rather approve each one by hand.

    .PARAMETER IncludeWindowsUpdate
        Install pending updates via the PSWindowsUpdate module, scanning Microsoft
        Update so Office and other Microsoft products are covered alongside the OS
        and drivers. Default: $true. Requires admin and may require a reboot.

    .PARAMETER IncludePowerShell7
        Install PowerShell 7 if missing, or upgrade it to the latest release.
        Default: $true. A machine-wide MSI install/upgrade requires admin.

    .PARAMETER SetPwshTerminalDefault
        Point Windows Terminal's default profile at PowerShell 7. Default: $true.
        Per-user change; silently skipped if Windows Terminal is not installed.

    .PARAMETER IncludePowerShellModules
        Update every installed PowerShell module. Default: $true.

        Set it to $false for a run that should leave modules alone, which is
        usually because one is pinned to a version something else depends on.
        The step is reported as skipped rather than dropped.

        -ExcludeTag PowerShell is the broader hammer: it also skips the gallery
        trust, the gallery tooling, help, PowerShell 7 and the Terminal default.

    .PARAMETER AutoReboot
        Allow Windows Update to reboot automatically if required. Default: $false

    .PARAMETER IncludePrerelease
        Include prerelease/preview builds where the tool supports it. Default: $false.
        Currently applies to PowerShell module updates (Update-PSResource -Prerelease
        / Update-Module -AllowPrerelease).

    .PARAMETER UpdateGlobalNpm
        Update global npm packages in addition to npm itself. Default: $false

    .PARAMETER SkipElevation
        Do not relaunch elevated. Steps marked as requiring administrator are
        reported as skipped with that reason rather than failing on a permissions
        error. Useful for unattended/standard-user runs.

    .PARAMETER AllowInstall
        Which missing components this run may install for the first time. Updating
        something already present never needs approval; installing something new
        always does.

        This is an update script, not an installer. Left unset, nothing new is
        installed: an interactive run asks before each one, and a non-interactive
        run (a scheduled task) declines and reports the step as skipped, because
        there is nobody there to ask.

        Accepts any of:
          All              approve everything below
          PowerShell7      install PowerShell 7 via winget (machine-wide MSI)
          PSWindowsUpdate  install the PSWindowsUpdate module (AllUsers scope)
          NuGetProvider    install or refresh the NuGet package provider
                           (the first bootstrap is CurrentUser; a refresh is
                           AllUsers when elevated, otherwise CurrentUser)
          BurntToast       install the BurntToast module for -Notify (CurrentUser)
          PowerShellGet    replace the PowerShellGet 1.0.0.1 Windows ships with
                           2.x, which can accept module licenses and can see
                           modules installed by newer versions (AllUsers when
                           elevated, otherwise CurrentUser)
          PSResourceGet    install Microsoft.PowerShell.PSResourceGet, the
                           current gallery client. Changes which client every
                           later module update uses (AllUsers when elevated,
                           otherwise CurrentUser)

        NuGetProvider also covers refreshing a provider that is already present.
        There is no update command for a package provider, so moving one forward
        means installing the newer version, and that asks.

        A scheduled task cannot prompt, so pass the approvals it should have:
            -AllowInstall PSWindowsUpdate,BurntToast

    .PARAMETER PromptBeforeRun
        Pause before doing anything and offer a way out: run now, skip this run, or
        wait -DelayMinutes and then run. Intended for a scheduled run that may land
        while you are in the middle of something.

        The prompt takes the default (run now) after -PromptTimeoutSeconds, so an
        unattended machine is never left waiting on an answer nobody is there to
        give. If the run cannot prompt at all -- a hidden window, redirected input --
        it says so and starts immediately rather than blocking.

    .PARAMETER PromptTimeoutSeconds
        How long the -PromptBeforeRun prompt waits before starting the run anyway.
        Default: 60.

    .PARAMETER DelayMinutes
        How long the "wait, then run" answer waits. Default: 60.

    .PARAMETER Attended
        Hold the window open after the summary until a key is pressed, for a run
        started from a shortcut or a Start-menu pin, where the window would
        otherwise close before anything could be read. Off by default, and a
        scheduled task never passes it. The hold ends on its own after
        -PromptTimeoutSeconds when that is given, otherwise after ten minutes, so
        an -Attended left in a task cannot hold it open until its time limit.

    .PARAMETER Notify
        Show Windows toast notifications when the run finishes: a summary, and a
        separate urgent notification when a restart is required. On unless
        -Notify:$false is passed; a bare -Notify, as older scheduled tasks pass
        it, means what it always did.

        Requires the BurntToast module (https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast) and an
        interactive desktop session. Either being absent degrades to no
        notifications; it never fails the run. When -Notify was not passed and
        BurntToast is not installed, the closing summary says so in one line and
        no install is offered; pass -Notify, or -AllowInstall BurntToast, to be
        asked.

        That check happens before the first update step, not at the end, so a
        warning lands at the top of the transcript rather than after a long run.
        The reason is repeated in the closing summary, because by then the original
        warning has scrolled well out of sight.

    .PARAMETER UpdateSelf
        Update this module through Update-Module (or the Main installer with
        -UpdateSelfSource Main), and run nothing else. Default: $false. -Tag and
        -ExcludeTag are ignored for the run, and no UAC prompt is raised: a
        per-user copy updates in place, and an all-users copy reports that it
        needs an elevated session rather than failing silently.

        The new version takes effect on the *next* run. This module is already
        loaded by the time the step runs: the files on disk are replaced, and
        the functions executing now stay on the code already in memory.

        Off by default. From Main it fetches and runs an installer from a
        branch, which is a supply-chain decision rather than a routine update,
        and a scheduled task that quietly followed main would be making that
        decision on every run.

    .PARAMETER Tag
        Run only the steps carrying one of these tags. Everything else is
        reported as skipped with that reason, so the summary still accounts for
        every step.

        A step carries one or more of: Windows, Microsoft, PowerShell,
        PackageManager, Python, Node, DotNet, Rust, Go, Cloud, Git, Self,
        Inventory.

            Update-Everything -Tag Python
            Update-Everything -Tag Inventory    report what is installed, update nothing

    .PARAMETER ExcludeTag
        Run everything except the steps carrying one of these tags. Takes the
        same values as -Tag.

            Update-Everything -ExcludeTag Python

        Both may be given at once, and exclusion wins. That makes two scheduled
        tasks able to divide the work between them: one that updates everything
        but Python daily, and one that updates only Python monthly, for a
        toolchain something else depends on being held steady.

    .PARAMETER UpdateSelfSource
        Where -UpdateSelf gets this module from. Default: Gallery.

          Gallery  the newest published release, through Update-Module
          Main     the development head, by fetching Install.ps1 from GitHub

        Gallery is the default because a published release is what most people
        want. Main is for tracking a fix that has landed but not shipped, and
        for testing.

        Gallery cannot move a copy that PowerShellGet did not install -- one put
        there by the GitHub installer, for instance. The run says so and names
        the way forward rather than failing.

    .PARAMETER LogRetentionDays
        Delete logs and settings.json backups in the log directory older than this
        many days. Default: 30. Set to 0 to keep everything.

    .PARAMETER StepTimeoutMinutes
        How long any one step may run before its child processes are stopped
        and the step is recorded as Failed, so the run goes on to its summary,
        its toast and its reboot check instead of being stopped whole at the
        task's execution time limit. Default: 0, no limit. Stops the native
        commands a step started -- winget, msiexec, npm -- and not a step that
        hangs inside a cmdlet in this process, such as a Windows Update scan
        that never returns.

    .PARAMETER IssuesFromLastRun
        Report the failures and warnings from the most recent run and update
        nothing. A scheduled run finishes in a session nobody was watching, so
        its result object is gone; this reads what it left in the log directory.
        Returns UpdateEverything.Issue objects rather than a run result.

    .PARAMETER IncludeSkipped
        Include skipped steps in that report. Off by default, because a declined
        install, a step filtered out by -Tag and a step needing rights this run
        did not have are all decisions rather than faults, and none of them count
        towards the exit code. Use this when auditing what a run did not do.

    .OUTPUTS
        An object describing the run:

          Ran            $false when nothing was attempted, for example because
                         the session could not become Administrator
          Reason         why it did not run, when Ran is $false
          Elevated       whether the run had administrator rights
          Steps          one record per step, with Status, Seconds and Log
          OkCount, WarningCount, SkippedCount, FailedCount
          RebootPending  whether Windows is waiting on a restart
          RebootReason   what is holding the restart
          LogDirectory   where the logs went
          MainLog        the transcript for this run

        FailedCount is what a scheduled task turns into an exit code. Warning
        steps completed and do not count.

    .NOTES
        Elevation is checked before it is requested. A standard user gets a clear
        explanation and a result with Ran = $false rather than a UAC prompt that
        cannot succeed. Run with -SkipElevation to perform the steps that do not
        need admin.

        Execution policy: the elevated relaunch passes -ExecutionPolicy Bypass.
        Importing the module obeys whatever policy is in force, so on a machine
        set to AllSigned or Restricted, start the session with:
            pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Import-Module UpdateEverything; Update-Everything"
