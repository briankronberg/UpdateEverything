#Requires -Version 5.1

.SYNOPSIS
    Installs the UpdateEverything module, either from a clone or straight from
    GitHub.

.DESCRIPTION
    Downloads the repository and installs the module when run on its own, and
    installs from the clone it sits in when there is one. So both of these work:

        # from a clone
        powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install.ps1 -Force

        # from nothing but the URL
        $installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'Install-UpdateEverything.ps1'
        Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/briankronberg/UpdateEverything/main/Install.ps1 -OutFile $installer -UseBasicParsing
        Unblock-File $installer
        powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $installer -Force

    Downloaded, then run, rather than piped through Invoke-Expression. The
    "irm ... | iex" idiom reads shorter but Defender blocks process creation on
    a command line containing it, whatever the command actually does, so it
    fails outright on a machine with attack surface reduction turned on.
    Unblock-File clears the mark of the web, which an execution policy of
    RemoteSigned would otherwise refuse.

    Installs for the current user by default, which needs no elevation, and for
    both PowerShell editions, because they read different module folders.

.PARAMETER FromGitHub
    Download the module from GitHub even when a local src folder is present.
    Use this to test what someone else installing it would get.

.PARAMETER Repository
    The owner/name to download from. Default:
    briankronberg/UpdateEverything.

.PARAMETER Ref
    Branch or tag to download. Default: main.

.PARAMETER Scope
    CurrentUser (default) installs into your own module path and needs no admin
    rights. AllUsers installs machine-wide and does.

.PARAMETER CurrentEditionOnly
    Install only for the edition running this script. By default it installs for
    both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell 7. Installing from pwsh alone would
    leave the module invisible to the edition the manifest promises to support.

.PARAMETER Force
    Overwrite an existing install of the same version.

.PARAMETER PassThru
    Return the installed module rather than only printing a summary.

.PARAMETER RemoveOldVersions
    After a successful install, remove older versions of the module. It keeps
    the version just installed and repairs any scheduled task to point at it.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install.ps1 -FromGitHub

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install.ps1 -Scope AllUsers

.NOTES
    Uninstall by deleting the folder this reports.
    -RemoveOldVersions only removes older versions; uninstalling entirely means
    deleting all the folders the summary reports.
